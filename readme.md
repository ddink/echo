## Work In Progress

I've added Foundation CSS and JS into the public folder to provide a starting point on the front-end. I've also added the laravel-console, monolog packages, and the code sniffer and faker packages in dev. I plan to complete the integration of the app's main functionality (messaging). After that I'll add some user authentication and probably add phpunit.

## Documentation

There are only two routes in the application. '/' is the index route. It will take you to the laravel hello view. '/console' is the console route, and it will take you to the console. There are messages routes, but they're still in dev so 'messages/$id' will throw an error.
